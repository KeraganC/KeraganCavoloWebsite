------------------

Human potential knows no bounds. Mounds of research support humans’ potential for resilience, malleability, and efficacy. Striving for goals that are in line with our values results in a more fulfilled and connected life. Data supports - and I believe is a prerequisite for - this.

Life can be difficult, but data offers us insight into the root causes of suffering and can be leveraged in developing strategies for managing life’s ups and downs. My passion lies in bridging the gap between data and social-emotional health & well-being. I want to push forward individual, organizational, and community wellness through the power of data and innovation.

I have over four years of experience with data analytics in psychology, digital marketing, and the non-profit sector. My experience includes: 

1) Developing and conducting quantitative and qualitative studies 

2) Using SPSS, R, Microsoft Excel/Google Sheets, and Tableau for hypothesis testing, exploratory analysis, correlations, linear regression, and mixed-methods ANOVA 

3) Presenting findings and action items to stakeholders

4) Working cross-functionally on several projects at a time 

In my current role at Special Olympics Arizona, we have grown our social media following by 133% due to our data-driven strategy.

Also, check out The xSELerate Positivity Podcast to hear me talk with mental health professionals and SEL experts about evidence-based strategies for enhancing your self-awareness, relationship skills, decision-making skills, and more!

In my spare time, you can find me hanging out with my dogs, taking an online course to enhance my technical skills, listening to data analytics and psychology podcasts, or reading.

## This Website

As I develop my portfolio, each tab will comprise different data analytics projects I have done - some professional, some just for fun! I created this website using Rmarkdown and Github Pages, so consider this to be a project as well. Feel free to explore and reach out to me if you would like to connect!
