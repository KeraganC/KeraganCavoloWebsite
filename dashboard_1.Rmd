## Background

I created this dashboard using a subset of the Roosevelt Row Arts District dataset that I used to in Project 1 of this portfolio. For the purpose of this dashboard I included respondents who categorized themselves as *only* artists, residents, or visitors. Thus, I leave out a large number of people who were a combination of these (e.g., residents AND artists). I did this so I would be able to compare across independent groups using a filter for this dashboard.
